## Description
---
Chances are you are at one point in your life you were out of the house and needed to use the restroom but had an incredibly difficult time finding one. If you are in a city like New York it could feel almost impossible to find one. The goal of this application is to solve that and make finding a public restroom as easy as possibly. Using the Google Maps API with data submitted by users results in a convenient to use website and in the future a mobile app. 

Users can scroll around on google maps to find all the public restrooms near them. If they click on a marker on the map it will bring up information on the restroom like its address, ratings on the restrooms cleanliness and location, a description of the restroom, and an image if available. Users can also add a bathroom themselves via Latitude and Longitude.
